## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I come from an Electrical Engineering background, and my deep love for mathematics and physics naturally led me into the world of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI**.  
I found these fields absolutely fascinating — the perfect combination of logic, creativity, and problem-solving — and I've chosen to shift my career into this domain because I truly feel *at home* in it.

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s degree**, focusing on using advanced AI techniques, especially **Transformers**, for **time-series forecasting** in the renewable energy and power systems domain.

I enjoy learning something new every day, exploring how AI can solve real-world problems, and building practical projects that strengthen both my knowledge and my portfolio.
